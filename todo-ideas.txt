# Rough Drawer Component - Improvement Ideas

## Architecture & Standards
- [ ] Implement Shadow DOM for proper encapsulation and style isolation
- [ ] Add observedAttributes static getter and attributeChangedCallback lifecycle
- [ ] Implement proper disconnectedCallback for cleanup
- [ ] Add type-safe attribute parsing with validation

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Add ARIA attributes (role="dialog", aria-expanded, aria-hidden)
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab trapping)
- [ ] Add focus management (focus trap when open, restore focus on close)
- [ ] Support for screen readers with proper announcements

## Performance & Modern Features
- [ ] Add ResizeObserver for responsive behavior (debounced)
- [ ] Use passive event listeners where appropriate
- [ ] Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support
- [ ] Consider using CSS Container Queries for responsive design
- [ ] Optimize dragging with RAF (requestAnimationFrame)

## CSS & Theming
- [ ] Expand CSS custom properties for better theming
- [ ] Add CSS logical properties for RTL support
- [ ] Improve backdrop-filter support for modern blur effects
- [ ] Better responsive breakpoint handling

## Developer Experience
- [ ] Add TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Implement better error handling and validation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for better IDE support
- [ ] Consider adding animation event callbacks

## Native-like Behaviors
- [ ] Implement proper touch-action handling
- [ ] Add haptic feedback support (where available)
- [ ] Better gesture recognition (swipe vs pan)
- [ ] Implement spring physics for more natural animations

## Code Quality
- [ ] Extract configuration to a separate module
- [ ] Implement proper event delegation patterns
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Consider using AbortController for event cleanup
